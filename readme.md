# Richard Stallman Portfolio Website

A minimalist, retro-inspired single-page portfolio website dedicated to Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation. This project showcases his contributions to software freedom through a clean, responsive design with smooth interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup with proper document structure
- **CSS3** - Modern layout with Flexbox and Grid, CSS variables, animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Lightweight interactivity without dependencies
- **Google Fonts** - Inter (body text) and Space Mono (headings/monospace)

## What I'm Proud Of

1. **Pure Vanilla JavaScript** - No dependencies means faster load times and easier maintenance. Although much of the JavaScript code was generated with AI assistance as I was learning the language, it helped me understand patterns and best practices.
2. **Responsive Grid Layouts** - Modern CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts
3. **One-File Simplicity** - All CSS in one file, all JS in one file—easy to navigate
